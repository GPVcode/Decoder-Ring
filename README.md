# Decoder Ring Project
Decoder Ring is a project I worked on thorugh the Thinkful, Software Engineering Bootcamp. This project gave me the opportunity to write complex algorithms and using unit tests with Mocha and Chai.

In summary, this project provides three different encoding and decoding methods: Caesar Shift, Polybius Square, and Substitution Cipher. 
- the Caesar Shift shifts all characters by the users given number. A positive number shifts letters to the right and negative numbers shift the letter to the left.
- the Polybius Square codes characters into numbers that represent a position in a two dimensional array called a polybius square.
- the substitution cipher uses a new set of the alphabet and exchanges the message according to the new alphabet set.
